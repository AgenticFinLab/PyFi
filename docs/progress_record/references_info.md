- **abstract**: Although large language models (LLMs) has shown great performance on natural language processing (NLP) in the financial domain, there are no publicly available financial tailtored LLMs, instruction tuning datasets, and evaluation benchmarks, which is critical for continually pushing forward the open-source development of financial artificial intelligence (AI). This paper introduces PIXIU, a comprehensive framework including the first financial LLM based on fine-tuning LLaMA with instruction data, the first instruction data with 136K data samples to support the fine-tuning, and an evaluation benchmark with 5 tasks and 9 datasets. We first construct the large-scale multi-task instruction data considering a variety of financial tasks, financial document types, and financial data modalities. We then propose a financial LLM called FinMA by fine-tuning LLaMA with the constructed dataset to be able to follow instructions for various financial tasks. To support the evaluation of financial LLMs, we propose a standardized benchmark that covers a set of critical financial tasks, including five financial NLP tasks and one financial prediction task. With this benchmark, we conduct a detailed analysis of FinMA and several existing LLMs, uncovering their strengths and weaknesses in handling critical financial tasks. The model, datasets, benchmark, and experimental results are open-sourced to facilitate future research in financial AI.

- **abstract**: LLM-based multi-agent has gained significant attention for their potential in simulation and enhancing performance. However, existing works are limited to pure simulations or are constrained by predefined workflows, restricting their applicability and effectiveness. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Agent Scaling Simulation (MASS) for portfolio construction. MASS achieves stable and continuous excess returns by progressively increasing the number of agents for large-scale simulations to gain a superior understanding of the market and optimizing agent distribution end-to-end through a reverse optimization process, rather than relying on a fixed workflow. We demonstrate its superiority through performance experiments, ablation studies, backtesting experiments, experiments on updated data and stock pools, scaling experiments, parameter sensitivity experiments, and visualization experiments, conducted in comparison with 6 state-of-the-art baselines on 3 challenging A-share stock pools. We expect the paradigm established by MASS to expand to other tasks with similar characteristics. The implementation of MASS has been open-sourced at this https URL.

- **abstract**: Large language models excel in general tasks, yet assessing their reliability in logic-heavy, precision-critical domains like finance, law, and healthcare remains challenging. To address this, we introduce BizFinBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in real-world financial applications. BizFinBench consists of 6,781 well-annotated queries in Chinese, spanning five dimensions: numerical calculation, reasoning, information extraction, prediction recognition, and knowledge-based question answering, grouped into nine fine-grained categories. The benchmark includes both objective and subjective metrics. We also introduce IteraJudge, a novel LLM evaluation method that reduces bias when LLMs serve as evaluators in objective metrics. We benchmark 25 models, including both proprietary and open-source systems. Extensive experiments show that no model dominates across all tasks. Our evaluation reveals distinct capability patterns: (1) In Numerical Calculation, Claude-3.5-Sonnet (63.18) and DeepSeek-R1 (64.04) lead, while smaller models like Qwen2.5-VL-3B (15.92) lag significantly; (2) In Reasoning, proprietary models dominate (ChatGPT-o3: 83.58, Gemini-2.0-Flash: 81.15), with open-source models trailing by up to 19.49 points; (3) In Information Extraction, the performance spread is the largest, with DeepSeek-R1 scoring 71.46, while Qwen3-1.7B scores 11.23; (4) In Prediction Recognition, performance variance is minimal, with top models scoring between 39.16 and 50.00. We find that while current LLMs handle routine finance queries competently, they struggle with complex scenarios requiring cross-concept reasoning. BizFinBench offers a rigorous, business-aligned benchmark for future research. The code and dataset are available at this https URL.

- **abstract**: Financial documents--such as 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and investor presentations--span hundreds of pages and combine diverse modalities, including dense narrative text, structured tables, and complex figures. Answering questions over such content often requires joint reasoning across modalities, which strains traditional large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines due to token limitations, layout loss, and fragmented cross-modal context. We introduce MultiFinRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework purpose-built for financial QA. MultiFinRAG first performs multimodal extraction by grouping table and figure images into batches and sending them to a lightweight, quantized open-source multimodal LLM, which produces both structured JSON outputs and concise textual summaries. These outputs, along with narrative text, are embedded and indexed with modality-aware similarity thresholds for precise retrieval. A tiered fallback strategy then dynamically escalates from text-only to text+table+image contexts when necessary, enabling cross-modal reasoning while reducing irrelevant context. Despite running on commodity hardware, MultiFinRAG achieves 19 percentage points higher accuracy than ChatGPT-4o (free-tier) on complex financial QA tasks involving text, tables, images, and combined multimodal reasoning.

- **problems**: 1. Financial documents are hundreds of pages and multimodal (text, tables, figures) so LLMs exceed token limits and costs explode. 2. Standard RAG flattens tables/charts into text, destroying layout and numeric context. 3. Fixed-size text chunks fragment coherent explanations and numeric context. 4. Static top-k retrieval returns redundant or marginally relevant snippets. 5. Existing systems cannot jointly reason across text, tables, and images.
- **problems-main-problem**: Enabling accurate and cost-effective question answering over long, multimodal financial documents that combine dense narrative text, structured tables, and complex figures.
- **problems-focus-problem**: How to retrieve, align, and synthesize information across text, tables, and figures within the token and compute constraints of commodity hardware.
- **problems-why-important**: Accurate QA on filings like 10-K/10-Q is critical for risk monitoring, compliance, and investment decisions; current LLMs and RAG pipelines fail on length, cost, and cross-modal reasoning, leading to unreliable answers.
- **motivations**: 1. Need for domain-specific RAG that handles multimodal financial content without proprietary APIs. 2. Demonstration that lightweight open-source multimodal LLMs can outperform closed-source models like ChatGPT-4o when paired with modality-aware retrieval. 3. Empirical evidence that semantic chunking, multimodal extraction, and tiered fallback improve both accuracy and efficiency.
- **motivations-main-finding**: MultiFinRAG achieves 75.3% overall accuracy on 300 hand-crafted questions, 19 pp higher than ChatGPT-4o (56.0%), while running on Google Colab free tier with quantized 12B models; text, table, and image modalities each contribute to gains.
- **motivations-main-insight**: Modality-aware retrieval thresholds (text 0.70, table 0.65, image 0.55) plus a tiered escalation from text-only to text+table+image balance precision and coverage, cutting token usage by ~60% without losing quality.
- **motivations-why-necessary**: Financial analysts need trustworthy, low-cost, and timely insights from filings; prior methods either ignore visual data or require expensive proprietary LLMs, leaving a practical gap that MultiFinRAG fills.
- **solutions**: MultiFinRAG: a three-stage pipeline—(1) batch multimodal extraction of tables/figures into JSON + summaries via quantized open-source multimodal LLMs, (2) semantic chunking & modality-aware FAISS indexing with similarity thresholds, (3) tiered fallback retrieval that escalates from text to text+table+image contexts when needed.
- **solutions-main-idea**: Preserve and leverage the native structure of text, tables, and figures by extracting them separately, embedding them with modality-specific similarity cut-offs, and dynamically combining only the minimal yet sufficient multimodal context for each query.
- **solutions-main-method**: Detectron2Layout + pdfminer for region detection; quantized Gemma3 12B or LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision for batched table parsing and image summarization; BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5 embeddings; FAISS IVF-PQ indexes; tiered retrieval logic with parameters k_text=6, k_table=4, k_image=3.
- **solutions-main-result**: 90.4% accuracy on text-only questions, 66.7% on image, 69.4% on table, 40% on combined; overall 75.3% vs 56.0% ChatGPT-4o; average 25 min processing of 200-page PDF with 200 tables 150 images on Colab T4 GPU; zero monetary cost.
- **solutions-main-conclusion**: A carefully engineered open-source pipeline can surpass proprietary LLMs on complex multimodal financial QA while dramatically reducing cost and token usage, proving that modality-aware retrieval and lightweight multimodal LLMs are sufficient for domain-specific intelligence.
- **potential-inspiration**: 1. Extend to cross-document and longitudinal analysis (compare 10-K vs 10-Q across years). 2. Ingest live web financial articles with embedded tables/charts for real-time QA. 3. Fine-tune retrieval/generation models on proprietary financial QA datasets. 4. Add robustness modules (OCR ensembles, consistency checks, error-correcting LLMs). 5. Generalize pipeline to other regulated domains (medical, legal) with similar multimodal document challenges.

- **abstract**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have experienced rapid development in recent years. However, in the financial domain, there is a notable lack of effective and specialized multimodal evaluation datasets. To advance the development of MLLMs in the finance domain, we introduce FinMME, encompassing more than 11,000 high-quality financial research samples across 18 financial domains and 6 asset classes, featuring 10 major chart types and 21 subtypes. We ensure data quality through 20 annotators and carefully designed validation mechanisms. Additionally, we develop FinScore, an evaluation system incorporating hallucination penalties and multi-dimensional capability assessment to provide an unbiased evaluation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o exhibit unsatisfactory performance on FinMME, highlighting its challenging nature. The benchmark exhibits high robustness with prediction variations under different prompts remaining below 1%, demonstrating superior reliability compared to existing datasets.

- **abstract**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited notable efficacy in question-answering (QA) tasks across diverse domains. Their prowess in integrating extensive web knowledge has fueled interest in developing LLM-based autonomous agents. While LLMs are efficient in decoding human instructions and deriving solutions by holistically processing historical inputs, transitioning to purpose-driven agents requires a supplementary rational architecture to process multi-source information, establish reasoning chains, and prioritize critical tasks. Addressing this, we introduce FinMem, a novel LLM-based agent framework devised for financial decision-making. It encompasses three core modules: Profiling, to customize the agent's characteristics; Memory, with layered message processing, to aid the agent in assimilating hierarchical financial data; and Decision-making, to convert insights gained from memories into investment decisions. Notably, FinMem's memory module aligns closely with the cognitive structure of human traders, offering robust interpretability and real-time tuning. Its adjustable cognitive span allows for the retention of critical information beyond human perceptual limits, thereby enhancing trading outcomes. This framework enables the agent to self-evolve its professional knowledge, react agilely to new investment cues, and continuously refine trading decisions in the volatile financial environment. We first compare FinMem with various algorithmic agents on a scalable real-world financial dataset, underscoring its leading trading performance in stocks. We then fine-tuned the agent's perceptual span and character setting to achieve a significantly enhanced trading performance. Collectively, FinMem presents a cutting-edge LLM agent framework for automated trading, boosting cumulative investment returns.

- **problems**: 1. Human traders have cognitive limitations in processing vast and diverse financial data. 2. Existing DRL agents lack interpretability and struggle to integrate textual and numerical data. 3. Current LLM-based agents act mainly as QA systems and fail to prioritize temporally sensitive financial information. 4. Lack of memory mechanisms leads to poor retention and prioritization of critical events.
- **problems-main-problem**: Bridging the gap between general LLM capabilities and the specialized needs of autonomous, interpretable, and memory-equipped financial trading agents.

- **problems-why-important**: Overcoming human cognitive limits and DRL interpretability issues can significantly improve trading performance, risk management, and trust in autonomous systems; efficient processing of multi-modal data is crucial in volatile markets.
- **motivations**: 1. Leverage LLMs' pre-trained knowledge and reasoning to surpass DRL limitations. 2. Introduce layered memory to emulate human cognition and manage temporal hierarchies. 3. Provide transparent, adaptive, and self-evolving trading agents. 4. Demonstrate superior performance with limited training data.
- **motivations-main-finding**: FINMEM outperforms algorithmic baselines on a real-world stock dataset, achieves enhanced returns via tunable cognitive spans, and evolves its knowledge base continuously.
- **motivations-main-insight**: Mimicking human working and long-term memory layers, combined with dynamic character profiling, enables LLM agents to surpass human perceptual limits and adapt to market volatility without extensive retraining.
- **motivations-why-necessary**: Financial markets demand real-time, interpretable, and data-efficient decision-making; traditional models either lack transparency or cannot scale to textual data; a human-aligned memory system is essential for capturing nuanced, time-sensitive insights.
- **solutions**: FINMEM framework: three modules—Profiling (customizable risk-inclined persona), Memory (working + shallow/intermediate/deep long-term layers with recency-relevancy-importance metrics), Decision-making (synthesize memories with market state).
- **solutions-main-idea**: Embed hierarchical, human-like memory into an LLM agent to prioritize and retain multi-source financial information across time-scales, then couple it with a dynamic character profile to generate transparent, adaptive trading decisions.
- **solutions-main-method**: 1. Design layered memory with decay-tuned retention for daily news (shallow), quarterly data (intermediate), and annual reports (deep). 2. Retrieve top-k memories from each layer via weighted scoring. 3. Use prompt-driven LLM reasoning to reflect, summarize, and act. 4. Fine-tune perceptual span and persona via ablation studies.
- **solutions-main-result**: Achieves state-of-the-art cumulative returns on stocks, maintains robustness with smaller datasets, and allows real-time memory tuning to boost performance beyond human limits.
- **solutions-main-conclusion**: A cognitively-inspired, LLM-based trading agent with layered memory and dynamic profiling can effectively integrate heterogeneous financial data, deliver interpretable decisions, and continually evolve—outperforming prior DRL and LLM baselines.
- **potential-inspiration**: 1. Extend layered memory to other high-stakes domains (healthcare, cybersecurity) with time-critical data. 2. Combine memory with causal reasoning modules for deeper market insight. 3. Explore federated memory updates across multiple agents for collective intelligence. 4. Investigate ethical and regulatory frameworks for transparent autonomous trading.

- **abstract**: In financial quantitative investment analysis field, most of existing artificial intelligence analysis methods are based on sequential data, and very few research apply expert intuitive image experience based intelligence method to analyze many K-line patterns. In this paper, a Faster R-CNN based image recognition method is proposed to analyze and predict the financial image (e.g., w-bottom patterns, pivots in entanglement theory, trend and consolidation patterns, etc.). The proposed method can intuitively recognize the K-line pattern images effectively and accurately. To do so, a Faster R-CNN is firstly constructed. The financial data images are then fed into the constructed neural network for training. What is more, the trained network model is used to predict some new financial images. The proposed method can not only recognize a financial K-line pattern feature, but also recognize multiple-features image patterns. The experimental results show that the recognition algorithm based on Faster -R-CNN greatly improves the accuracy of K-line pattern recognition, and the method is effective.

- **abstract**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has
emerged as a key application of large language
models (LLMs), especially in vertical domains
where LLMs may lack domain-speciffc knowledge.
This paper introduces OmniEval, an omnidirectional
and automatic RAG benchmark
for the ffnancial domain, featured by its multidimensional
evaluation framework: First, we
categorize RAG scenarios by ffve task classes
and 16 ffnancial topics, leading to a matrixbased
structured assessment for RAG evaluation;
Next, we leverage a multi-dimensional
evaluation data generation method that integrates
GPT-4-based automatic generation and
human annotation approaches, achieving an
87.47% acceptance ratio in human evaluations
of generated instances; Further, we utilize a
multi-stage evaluation pipeline to assess both
retrieval and generation performance, resulting
in an all-sided evaluation of the RAG pipeline.
Finally, rule-based and LLM-based metrics are
combined to build a multi-dimensional evaluation
system, enhancing the reliability of assessments
through ffne-tuned LLM-based evaluators.
Our omnidirectional evaluation experiments
highlight the performance variations of
RAG systems across diverse topics and tasks
and reveal signiffcant opportunities for RAG
models to improve their capabilities in vertical
domains. The code link of our benchmark is

- **abstract**: [Answering questions within business and finance requires reasoning, precision, and a wide-breadth of technical knowledge. Together, these requirements make this domain difficult for large language models (LLMs). We introduce BizBench, a benchmark for evaluating models’ ability to reason about realistic financial problems. BizBench comprises eight quantitative reasoning tasks, focusing on question-answering (QA) over financial data via program synthesis. We include three financially-themed code-generation tasks from newly collected and augmented QA data. Additionally, we isolate the reasoning capabilities required for financial QA: reading comprehension of financial text and tables for extracting intermediate values, and understanding financial concepts and formulas needed to calculate complex solutions. Collectively, these tasks evaluate a model’s financial background knowledge, ability to parse financial documents, and capacity to solve problems with code. We conduct an in-depth evaluation of open-source and commercial LLMs, comparing and contrasting the behavior of code-focused and language-focused models. We demonstrate that the current bottleneck in performance is due to LLMs’ limited business and financial understanding, highlighting the value of a challenging benchmark for quantitative reasoning within this domain.](https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/OmniEval)

- **problems**: 1. Current LLMs struggle with precise, multi-step quantitative reasoning in business and finance. 2. Lack of transparent and auditable reasoning paths in high-stakes financial decisions. 3. No comprehensive benchmark measuring financial-domain code generation, quantity extraction, and domain knowledge in tandem. 4. Existing datasets ignore complex real-world financial documents and professional exam questions.
- **problems-main-problem**: The inability of large language models to perform transparent, accurate, and complex quantitative reasoning required for real-world business and finance tasks.
- **problems-focus-problem**: Designing a challenging, multi-task benchmark that evaluates LLMs’ ability to (a) extract correct numbers from noisy financial text/tables, (b) apply correct financial formulas, and (c) synthesize executable code that yields auditable answers.
- **problems-why-important**: Financial decisions involve large monetary stakes; even small errors can incur significant losses. Auditable reasoning is mandated by regulators and demanded by professionals. Improving these capabilities is crucial for trustworthy AI deployment in finance.
- **motivations**: • Introduce BizBench, the first holistic benchmark combining program synthesis, quantity extraction, and domain knowledge for finance. • Provide novel datasets (FinCode, SEC-Num, FormulaEval) and code-augmented versions of FinQA & TAT-QA. • Demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models (e.g., GPT-4) fail on ~36% of hardest tasks, primarily owing to gaps in financial knowledge. • Show that targeted supervised fine-tuning with modest data (<3k samples) can outperform much larger pretrained models.
- **motivations-main-finding**: GPT-4 tops the leaderboard yet still misses over one-third of FinCode questions; the dominant failure mode is lack of financial background knowledge rather than extraction or coding errors.
- **motivations-main-insight**: Transparent program synthesis is a more reliable evaluation paradigm than chain-of-thought for high-stakes finance QA because it ties outputs to executable, auditable code.
- **motivations-why-necessary**: Prior benchmarks only cover sentiment, NER, or stock prediction; none assess the full pipeline of locating numbers, selecting formulas, and computing answers with code. This gap hinders progress toward production-ready financial AI systems.
- **solutions**: • Create eight complementary tasks split into three categories: Program Synthesis (FinCode, CodeFinQA, CodeTAT-QA), Quantity Extraction (SEC-Num, ConvFinQA-E, TAT-QA-E), and Domain Knowledge (FinKnow, FormulaEval). • Frame every QA instance as a Python program synthesis problem to enforce transparency. • Curate questions from professional exams (CFA, CPA), SEC 10-K/Q filings, and existing datasets; augment with human-verified code solutions. • Evaluate 12 open-source & proprietary LLMs under zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned settings. • Provide public leaderboard and dataset to prevent contamination and spur community progress.
- **solutions-main-idea**: Reformulate financial question answering as executable code generation so that the reasoning chain is explicit, reproducible, and verifiable.
- **solutions-main-method**: (1) Expert curation & LLM-bootstrapping pipeline to generate semantically rich Python programs; (2) Strict unit-test evaluation where output is correct only if numeric answer is within 1% of ground truth; (3) Fine-tuning experiments showing data scaling laws across tasks.
- **solutions-main-result**: • GPT-4 achieves 63.6% on FinCode, 78.8% on CodeFinQA, 90.6% on CodeTAT-QA, 79.3% on SEC-Num, 100% on FormulaEval, and 80.1% on FinKnow. • Llama-2-7B fine-tuned on 3 k examples beats Llama-2-70B zero-shot by 9–13% absolute on three tasks at a fraction of inference cost. • Error analysis reveals 84% of residual GPT-4 errors stem from incorrect financial formulas or concepts.
- **solutions-main-conclusion**: Current LLMs’ limited financial domain knowledge is the primary bottleneck; transparent program-synthesis benchmarks like BizBench are essential to guide future model development, data collection, and evaluation in high-stakes finance.
- **potential-inspiration**: • Extend BizBench to multilingual corporate filings and non-US markets. • Integrate retrieval-augmented generation to fetch up-to-date regulations and definitions. • Explore symbolic-solver hybrids that combine LLM code generation with formal financial calculus engines. • Develop interactive debugging tools that let analysts step through generated code. • Create privacy-preserving federated fine-tuning protocols on bank-internal documents. • Adapt the benchmark for adjacent quantitative domains (insurance, real-estate, actuarial science).

- **abstract**: Misinformation poses significant risks to society, with the rise of cryptocurrency exchanges exemplifying the growing problem of financial misinformation. This issue is particularly troubling given the proliferation of false claims often paired with convincing yet misleading images. Despite the seriousness of this challenge, there is a notable absence of fact-checking datasets tailored to real-world financial claims. Additionally, given the high stakes of financial fact-checking, generating clear explanations for claim verdicts is essential to help decision-makers understand the reasoning behind these judgments. To address these challenges, we introduce Fin-Fact, a benchmark dataset comprising 3,369 financial claims. Each claim is annotated with a truthfulness label and a ruling statement, supported by both textual and visual evidence. We establish performance baselines for Fin-Fact using Gemini Pro and GPT-4. Our experimental results reveal that multimodal financial fact-checking remains a challenging task, even for cutting-edge generative models.

- **abstract**: LLMs have transformed NLP and shown promise in various fields, yet their potential in finance is underexplored due to a lack of comprehensive benchmarks, the rapid development of LLMs, and the complexity of financial tasks. In this paper, we introduce FinBen, the first extensive open-source evaluation benchmark, including 42 datasets spanning 24 financial tasks, covering eight critical aspects: information extraction (IE), textual analysis, question answering (QA), text generation, risk management, forecasting, decision-making, and bilingual (English and Spanish). FinBen offers several key innovations: a broader range of tasks and datasets, the first evaluation of stock trading, novel agent and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evaluation, and two novel datasets for regulations and stock trading. Our evaluation of 21 representative LLMs, including GPT-4, ChatGPT, and the latest Gemini, reveals several key findings: While LLMs excel in IE and textual analysis, they struggle with advanced reasoning and complex tasks like text generation and forecasting. GPT-4 excels in IE and stock trading, while Gemini is better at text generation and forecasting. Instruction-tuned LLMs improve textual analysis but offer limited benefits for complex tasks such as QA. FinBen has been used to host the first financial LLMs shared task at the FinNLP-AgentScen workshop during IJCAI-2024, attracting 12 teams. Their novel solutions outperformed GPT-4, showcasing FinBen's potential to drive innovations in financial LLMs. All datasets and code are publicly available for the research community, with results shared and updated regularly on the Open Financial LLM Leaderboard.

- **abstract**: Finance is a particularly challenging playground for deep reinforcement learning. However, establishing high-quality market environments and benchmarks for financial reinforcement learning is challenging due to three major factors, namely, low signal-to-noise ratio of financial data, survivorship bias of historical data, and backtesting overfitting. In this paper, we present an openly accessible FinRL-Meta library that has been actively maintained by the AI4Finance community. First, following a DataOps paradigm, we will provide hundreds of market environments through an automatic data curation pipeline that processes dynamic datasets from real-world markets into gym-style market environments. Second, we reproduce popular papers as stepping stones for users to design new trading strategies. We also deploy the library on cloud platforms so that users can visualize their own results and assess the relative performance via community-wise competitions. Third, FinRL-Meta provides tens of Jupyter/Python demos organized into a curriculum and a documentation website to serve the rapidly growing community.

- **abstract**: [FinanceBench is a first-of-its-kind test suite for evaluating the performance of LLMs on open book financial question answering (QA). It comprises 10,231 questions about publicly traded companies, with corresponding answers and evidence strings. The questions in FinanceBench are ecologically valid and cover a diverse set of scenarios. They are intended to be clear-cut and straightforward to answer to serve as a minimum performance standard. We test 16 state of the art model configurations (including GPT-4-Turbo, Llama2 and Claude2, with vector stores and long context prompts) on a sample of 150 cases from FinanceBench, and manually review their answers (n=2,400). The cases are available open-source. We show that existing LLMs have clear limitations for financial QA. Notably, GPT-4-Turbo used with a retrieval system incorrectly answered or refused to answer 81% of questions. While augmentation techniques such as using longer context window to feed in relevant evidence improve performance, they are unrealistic for enterprise settings due to increased latency and cannot support larger financial documents. We find that all models examined exhibit weaknesses, such as hallucinations, that limit their suitability for use by enterprises. ](https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRL-Meta)

- **problems**: Lack of rigorous evaluation for LLMs in finance; existing datasets are generic or sentiment-focused; models hallucinate, fail at numerical reasoning, and struggle with long documents; unclear suitability for high-stakes enterprise use.
- **problems-main-problem**: No comprehensive, ecologically valid benchmark to assess LLM performance on open-book financial QA tasks involving real-world financial documents and metrics.
- **problems-focus-problem**: How well do state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4-Turbo, Claude2, Llama2) perform on retrieving and reasoning over financial documents (10-Ks, 10-Qs, 8-Ks) to answer analyst-style questions?
- **problems-why-important**: Financial decisions are high-stakes; errors propagate into investment strategies and due diligence; without reliable benchmarks, enterprises cannot safely adopt LLMs.
- **motivations**: Introduce FINANCEBENCH, the first large-scale, open-book financial QA benchmark covering 40 companies, 361 filings, 2015-2023, with extractive, numerical, and logical reasoning questions designed by finance experts.
- **motivations-main-finding**: Even best model (GPT-4-Turbo + long context) only 79 % accurate; retrieval (vector store, long context) is necessary but not sufficient; hallucinations and refusal-to-answer remain major issues; performance drops sharply when documents are shared across companies.
- **motivations-main-insight**: Current LLMs are not yet ready for unsupervised enterprise financial QA; retrieval quality and reasoning accuracy must both improve; prompt order (context-first vs context-last) significantly affects long-context performance.
- **motivations-why-necessary**: Provides transparent, reproducible yardstick for practitioners and researchers to measure progress and identify failure modes before real-world deployment.
- **solutions**: Release FINANCEBENCH dataset and evaluation protocol; test 16 configurations spanning closed-book, oracle, single/shared vector stores, long-context windows; human expert review of 2,400 answers; open-source 150-case sample.
- **solutions-main-idea**: Create an ecologically valid benchmark that mirrors daily analyst workflows: retrieve evidence from filings and compute or extract answers, then rigorously score outputs.
- **solutions-main-method**: Multi-disciplinary team of finance analysts annotated questions, answers, evidence strings; programmatic generation of metrics-based questions; stratified evaluation across question types and models; qualitative error analysis.
- **solutions-main-result**: Public leaderboard showing GPT-4-Turbo (long context) 79 %, Claude2 76 %, GPT-4-Turbo (shared vector) 19 %, Llama2 19 %; oracle setting peaks at 85 %; 81 % of GPT-4-Turbo+shared vector answers were wrong or refused.
- **solutions-main-conclusion**: Retrieval augmentation is essential; longer context helps but is costly and still error-prone; all models exhibit hallucinations; enterprises must validate outputs with multiple sources before use.
- **potential-inspiration**: Develop retrieval systems tuned for financial jargon; chain-of-thought prompting for numerical reasoning; fine-tuning on FINANCEBENCH; conversational multi-turn QA; cross-company comparative QA; extend to private documents; integrate calculators/APIs to reduce hallucinations.

- **abstract**: In light of recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) that have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), there is an urgent need for new benchmarks to keep pace with the fast development of LLMs. In this paper, we propose CFLUE, the Chinese Financial Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark, designed to assess the capability of LLMs across various dimensions. Specifically, CFLUE provides datasets tailored for both knowledge assessment and application assessment. In knowledge assessment, it consists of 38K+ multiple-choice questions with associated solution explanations. These questions serve dual purposes: answer prediction and question reasoning. In application assessment, CFLUE features 16K+ test instances across distinct groups of NLP tasks such as text classification, machine translation, relation extraction, reading comprehension, and text generation. Upon CFLUE, we conduct a thorough evaluation of representative LLMs. The results reveal that only Qwen-72B, GPT-4, and GPT-4-turbo achieve an accuracy exceeding 60% in answer prediction for knowledge assessment, suggesting that there is still substantial room for improvement in current LLMs. In application assessment, while GPT-4 and GPT-4-turbo rank as the top two performers on average, their significant advantage over open-source LLMs is noticeably diminished, given that Qwen-72B achieves the best performance in 2 out of 5 tasks. The datasets and scripts associated with CFLUE are openly accessible at https://github.com/aliyun/cflue.

- **abstract**: [The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) mandates all public companies to file periodic financial statements that should contain numerals annotated with a particular label from a taxonomy. In this paper, we formulate the task of automating the assignment of a label to a particular numeral span in a sentence from an extremely large label set. Towards this task, we release a dataset, Financial Numeric Extreme Labelling (FNXL), annotated with 2,794 labels. We benchmark the performance of the FNXL dataset by formulating the task as (a) a sequence labelling problem and (b) a pipeline with span extraction followed by Extreme Classification. Although the two approaches perform comparably, the pipeline solution provides a slight edge for the least frequent labels.](https://github.com/aliyun/cflue.)

- **base-core-group**: Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur; Goldman Sachs, Data Science & Machine Learning
- **problems**: 1) Manual XBRL tagging of numerals in SEC filings is labor-intensive; 2) Existing datasets only cover ~139 frequent labels, whereas real-world labels exceed 2,000; 3) Extreme label imbalance with a long-tail distribution; 4) Need for automation to handle evolving US-GAAP taxonomy
- **problems-main-problem**: Automating the assignment of the correct XBRL/US-GAAP label to each numeric span in SEC filings when the label space is extremely large (2,794 labels)
- **problems-focus-problem**: Designing and benchmarking methods that can accurately tag numerals under an extreme-classification regime with scarce data for most labels
- **problems-why-important**: Reduces manual annotation cost; ensures consistent and scalable tagging of new and legacy filings; supports regulatory compliance and downstream financial analytics
- **motivations**: Release of FNXL, the first large-scale dataset with 2,794 XBRL labels; demonstration that extreme-classification (AttentionXML) competes with and even surpasses sequence-labelling (FiNER) on macro metrics, especially for infrequent labels; human-in-the-loop evaluation showing practical utility
- **motivations-main-finding**: AttentionXML pipeline achieves 47.54% Macro-F1 vs 47.13% for best FiNER, while FiNER leads on Micro-F1 (75.84%); pipeline excels on least frequent labels (42.77% vs 39.17%); Hits@5≈90% enables efficient SME review
- **motivations-main-insight**: Treating XBRL tagging as extreme multi-label text classification after span extraction can outperform pure sequence labelling when the label space is large and skewed; masking strategies and model choice should depend on label frequency
- **motivations-why-necessary**: Real-world SEC filings demand handling thousands of labels; previous 139-label simplification insufficient; need rigorous benchmarks and human validation for trustworthy automation
- **solutions**: Two-fold: (a) sequence labelling with FiNER (BERT-based, subword tokenization with [NUM]/[SHAPE] pseudo-tokens), (b) pipeline of span extraction followed by extreme classification with AttentionXML (BiLSTM+attention, masking non-relevant numerals)
- **solutions-main-idea**: Combine precise numeral span detection with powerful extreme-classification to cope with 2,794 US-GAAP labels; leverage masking to focus context on the target numeral
- **solutions-main-method**: 1) Train binary BERT tagger to detect relevant numerals; 2) Feed sentence with non-relevant numerals masked to AttentionXML for label prediction; 3) Compare against FiNER end-to-end sequence labelling
- **solutions-main-result**: AttentionXML pipeline yields best Macro-F1 (47.54%); FiNER best Micro-F1 (75.84%); both methods struggle on zero-shot labels; human evaluation confirms top-5 suggestions save ~30 annotations/hour
- **solutions-main-conclusion**: Extreme-classification pipelines are viable for large-scale XBRL tagging, especially for tail labels; future gains may come from richer context and human-AI feedback loops
- **potential-inspiration**: Extend FNXL to include annotated words and tables; integrate paragraph-level context and tabular metadata; explore prompt-based few-shot learning for zero-shot labels; develop active-learning loops that leverage SME feedback to iteratively refine models; investigate hierarchical label structures or label embeddings to exploit semantic similarity

- **abstract**: Hybrid data combining both tabular and textual content (e.g., financial reports) are quite pervasive in the real world. However, Question Answering (QA) over such hybrid data is largely neglected in existing research. In this work, we extract samples from real financial reports to build a new large-scale QA dataset containing both Tabular And Textual data, named TAT-QA, where numerical reasoning is usually required to infer the answer, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, counting, comparison/sorting, and the compositions. We further propose a novel QA model termed TAGOP, which is capable of reasoning over both tables and text. It adopts sequence tagging to extract relevant cells from the table along with relevant spans from the text to infer their semantics, and then applies symbolic reasoning over them with a set of aggregation operators to arrive at the final answer. TAGOP achieves 58.0% inF1, which is an 11.1% absolute increase over the previous best baseline model, according to our experiments on TAT-QA. But this result still lags far behind performance of expert human, i.e.90.8% in F1. It is demonstrated that our TAT-QA is very challenging and can serve as a benchmark for training and testing powerful QA models that address hybrid form data.

- **abstract**: Pre-trained language models have shown impressive performance on a variety of tasks and domains. Previous research on financial language models usually employs a generic training scheme to train standard model architectures, without completely leveraging the richness of the financial data. We propose a novel domain specific Financial LANGuage model (FLANG) which uses financial keywords and phrases for better masking, together with span boundary objective and in-filing objective. Additionally, the evaluation benchmarks in the field have been limited. To this end, we contribute the Financial Language Understanding Evaluation (FLUE), an open-source comprehensive suite of benchmarks for the financial domain. These include new benchmarks across 5 NLP tasks in financial domain as well as common benchmarks used in the previous research. Experiments on these benchmarks suggest that our model outperforms those in prior literature on a variety of NLP tasks. Our models, code and benchmark data will be made publicly available on Github and Huggingface.

- **problems-main-problem**: The absence of a domain-specific pre-training strategy and a holistic evaluation benchmark for financial language understanding tasks
- **problems-focus-problem**: How to inject financial domain knowledge—especially multi-word financial terms—into pre-training via preferential masking and span boundary objectives, and how to create a unified benchmark suite (FLUE) for rigorous evaluation
- **problems-why-important**: Financial text contains domain-specific semantics where generic models underperform; accurate models can improve investment decisions, risk assessment, and market analytics; comprehensive benchmarks are needed for fair comparison and progress tracking
- **motivations**: 1. Financial language differs from general language (e.g., “oil prices up” is negative). 2. Multi-token phrases carry critical meaning. 3. Existing benchmarks cover only sentiment, lacking breadth. 4. Need reproducible, open-source resources
- **motivations-main-finding**: FLANG-BERT and FLANG-ELECTRA outperform FinBERT and baselines on all 5 FLUE tasks; span boundary + phrase masking yields state-of-the-art results; preferential 30 % masking of financial tokens minimizes perplexity; FLUE benchmark becomes a standard for financial NLP
- **motivations-main-insight**: Preferentially masking domain terms and phrases, combined with span boundary objectives, robustly encodes multi-word financial concepts; evaluation must span multiple task types to truly measure domain adaptation
- **motivations-why-necessary**: Generic models misinterpret financial nuances; without comprehensive benchmarks and domain-aware training, progress remains opaque and incremental; reproducible models and data accelerate research and industry adoption
- **solutions**: 1. FLANG-BERT: BERT-base with financial word/phrase masking. 2. FLANG-ELECTRA: ELECTRA-base + phrase masking + span boundary objective + supervised contrastive fine-tuning. 3.

- **solutions-main-idea**: Inject financial domain knowledge into pre-training by strategically masking financial words/phrases and predicting span boundaries, then evaluate on a broad, open benchmark
- **solutions-main-method**: Multi-stage pre-training: first mask single financial tokens, then mask multi-token phrases; span boundary objective trains generator to reconstruct masked spans from boundary representations; fine-tune with cross-entropy plus supervised contrastive loss on FLUE tasks
- **solutions-main-result**: Accuracy gains: FPB sentiment +4.0 % over FinBERT; FiQA sentiment MSE 0.034 vs 0.070; headline F1 0.978 vs 0.968; NER F1 0.83 vs 0.80; QA nDCG 0.55 vs 0.42; lowest perplexity 17.34 on validation set
- **solutions-main-conclusion**: Domain-specific masking and span objectives yield superior financial language models; FLUE provides a rigorous, open benchmark; techniques generalize to other domains
- **potential-inspiration**: 1. Extend FLUE to abstractive summarization once large annotated datasets exist. 2. Incorporate social media (Twitter, Reddit) with noise-robust masking. 3. Adapt method to multilingual financial corpora. 4. Apply span boundary idea to other specialized domains (legal, medical). 5. Explore decoder-only or sequence-to-sequence models (GPT, T5) for financial generation tasks.

- **abstract**: Finance decision-making often relies on in-depth data analysis across various data sources, including financial tables, news articles, stock prices, etc. In this work, we introduce FinTMMBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating temporal-aware multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in finance. Built from heterologous data of NASDAQ 100 companies, FinTMMBench offers three significant advantages. 1) Multi-modal Corpus: It encompasses a hybrid of financial tables, news articles, daily stock prices, and visual technical charts as the corpus. 2) Temporal-aware Questions: Each question requires the retrieval and interpretation of its relevant data over a specific time period, including daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual periods. 3) Diverse Financial Analysis Tasks: The questions involve 10 different tasks, including information extraction, trend analysis, sentiment analysis and event detection, etc. We further propose a novel TMMHybridRAG method, which first leverages LLMs to convert data from other modalities (e.g., tabular, visual and time-series data) into textual format and then incorporates temporal information in each node when constructing graphs and dense indexes. Its effectiveness has been validated in extensive experiments, but notable gaps remain, highlighting the challenges presented by our FinTMMBench.

- **problems**: Existing financial QA benchmarks either: (1) cover only limited modalities (text, time-series, or visual individually), (2) ignore explicit temporal constraints critical to financial analysis, or (3) fail to require retrieval across heterogeneous data types. Consequently, current RAG systems cannot be reliably evaluated for real-world finance decision-making that demands multi-modal, time-sensitive evidence.
- **problems-main-problem**: Lack of a comprehensive benchmark and retrieval method that jointly handle multi-modal financial data (tabular, textual, time-series, visual) under explicit temporal constraints.
- **problems-focus-problem**: How to design a benchmark and a retrieval system that can accurately answer temporal-aware questions requiring synchronized evidence from heterogeneous financial modalities.
- **problems-why-important**: Accurate, time-sensitive synthesis of multi-modal financial evidence is fundamental for equity investment, risk management, and regulatory compliance; gaps in evaluation tools impede progress toward trustworthy AI in finance.
- **motivations**: Propose the first temporal-aware multi-modal RAG benchmark (FinTMMBench) with 7 380 QA pairs spanning 10 financial tasks and 4 modalities; introduce TMMHybridRAG that integrates dense retrieval and temporal knowledge graphs with multi-modal LLM reasoning.
- **motivations-main-finding**: TMMHybridRAG significantly outperforms BM25, Naive RAG, GraphRAG, and LightRAG on FinTMMBench, yet absolute F1 remains low (23.71 %), indicating that the benchmark poses strong unsolved challenges.
- **motivations-main-insight**: Effective financial RAG requires explicit encoding of temporal properties at both indexing and retrieval stages; multi-modal data must be converted into shared textual-graph representations while preserving raw data fidelity for final generation.
- **motivations-why-necessary**: Prior benchmarks omit either modality diversity or temporal awareness, leaving no standard to measure progress toward practical financial RAG systems; a rigorous benchmark and baseline method are prerequisites for future research and deployment.
- **solutions**: Construct FinTMMBench from NASDAQ-100 data across 1 500 tables, 3 133 news, 25 200 daily stock prices, 6 267 charts; design 100 templates with chain-of-thought guidelines to generate temporal QA pairs; develop TMMHybridRAG that unifies dense vectors and temporal knowledge graphs with multi-modal LLM generation.
- **solutions-main-idea**: Convert every modality into entity-relation-text descriptions enriched with temporal metadata, then perform joint dense + graph retrieval conditioned on explicit time constraints, finally generate answers by grounding reasoning on retrieved raw data.
- **solutions-main-method**: (1) Pre-processing: LLM summarization of tables/charts/prices into textual entities with temporal properties; (2) Indexing: temporal dense vectors + temporal heterogeneous graph; (3) Retrieval: keyword expansion → dense top-k + graph neighborhood search; (4) Generation: multi-modal LLM reasoning over retrieved entities, relations, and raw data.
- **solutions-main-result**: TMMHybridRAG achieves EM 9.07 %, F1 23.71, Accuracy 10.42 %, LLM-judge Accuracy 22.65 %, besting all baselines; ablations show temporal and raw-data components are essential; error analysis reveals 46.5 % retrieval failures and 29 % calculation errors as dominant issues.
- **solutions-main-conclusion**: FinTMMBench provides the first rigorous testbed for temporal-aware multi-modal financial RAG; TMMHybridRAG establishes a strong baseline but highlights substantial room for improvement, especially in retrieval recall and numerical reasoning.
- **potential-inspiration**: (1) Develop retrieval architectures that natively handle multi-modal alignment without heavy textualization; (2) incorporate external symbolic calculators to reduce arithmetic errors; (3) explore continual learning to adapt models to evolving market terminology; (4) extend benchmark to intraday tick data and alternative data (social media, satellite imagery); (5) integrate causal inference for counterfactual financial reasoning tasks.

- **abstract**: This paper investigates predicting market strength solely from candlestick chart images to assist investment decisions. The core research problem is developing an effective computer vision-based model using raw candlestick visuals without time-series data. We specifically analyze the impact of incorporating candlestick patterns that were detected by YOLOv8. The study implements two approaches: pure CNN on chart images and a Decomposer architecture detecting patterns. Experiments utilize diverse financial datasets spanning stocks, cryptocurrencies, and forex assets. Key findings demonstrate candlestick patterns do not improve model performance over only image data in our research. The significance is illuminating limitations in candlestick image signals. Performance peaked at approximately 0.7 accuracy, below more complex time-series models. Outcomes reveal challenges in distilling sufficient predictive power from visual shapes alone, motivating the incorporation of other data modalities. This research clarifies how purely image-based models can inform trading while confirming patterns add little value over raw charts. Our content is endeavored to be delineated into distinct sections, each autonomously furnishing a unique contribution while maintaining cohesive linkage. Note that, the examples discussed herein are not limited to the scope, applicability, or knowledge outlined in the paper.

- **problems**: The paper investigates whether raw candlestick chart images alone (without time-series data) can predict market strength; it evaluates whether explicitly detecting candlestick patterns via YOLOv8 improves CNN performance; it highlights limitations in deriving predictive power from visual shapes alone.
- **problems-main-problem**: Can market strength be predicted from candlestick chart images using CNNs without time-series data, and does incorporating detected candlestick patterns improve performance?
- **problems-focus-problem**: Determining whether candlestick patterns add value over raw chart images for CNN-based market strength prediction.
- **problems-why-important**: Accurate market strength prediction aids traders and investors in making informed decisions; understanding the utility of visual patterns vs raw images clarifies the role of technical analysis in algorithmic trading; it informs resource allocation for model development.
- **motivations**: To explore an image-only approach for market prediction; to assess the impact of integrating pattern detection into CNNs; to determine limitations of visual-only models and motivate multi-modal enhancements.
- **motivations-main-finding**: Candlestick patterns detected by YOLOv8 do not improve CNN performance over raw candlestick images; pure CNNs achieve ~0.7 accuracy, below complex time-series models; visual-only models have limited predictive power.
- **motivations-main-insight**: Pattern-based features derived from candlestick images do not provide additional discriminative power beyond raw price visuals; temporal context in time-series data is superior for pattern recognition; integrating other data modalities is necessary for better accuracy.
- **motivations-why-necessary**: Existing reliance on pattern detection may misallocate computational resources; clarifying limitations guides future model design toward hybrid or time-series approaches; highlights gaps in purely vision-based financial forecasting.
- **solutions**: Two approaches: (1) Pure CNN (VGG16 backbone) on raw candlestick images vs images with YOLOv8-detected patterns; (2) Decomposer architecture (segmenting charts into sub-charts via custom Decomposer, CNN-autoencoder, CNN1D) on raw images.
- **solutions-main-idea**: Evaluate CNN architectures to extract market strength signals from candlestick images, comparing pattern-inclusive vs pattern-exclusive inputs and a decomposed sub-chart method.
- **solutions-main-method**: CNNs with VGG16 for feature extraction; YOLOv8 for pattern detection; Two-Stream CNN; Decomposer framework adapted from Deep Candlestick Predictor; datasets spanning stocks, forex, crypto (2017-2023 daily data).
- **solutions-main-result**: VGG16 without patterns achieves 0.765 (BTC), 0.753 (EUR-USD), 0.701 (AAPL); adding patterns does not improve and sometimes degrades performance; Decomposer yields ~0.5 (random guess); diversity of datasets does not enhance accuracy.
- **solutions-main-conclusion**: Raw candlestick images suffice for CNN-based market strength prediction; explicit pattern detection adds no value; time-series data remains superior; future work should integrate additional modalities like volume or LSTM.
- **potential-inspiration**: Combine CNNs with LSTM or attention mechanisms to capture temporal dynamics; explore transfer learning from pre-trained vision models; incorporate trading volume, sentiment, or macro indicators; develop synthetic datasets for rare patterns; investigate adversarial robustness of visual models in finance.

- **abstract**: Chart interpretation is crucial for visual data analysis, but accurately extracting information from charts poses significant challenges for automated models. This study investigates the fine-tuning of DEPLOT, a modality conversion module that translates the image of a plot or chart to a linearized table, on a custom dataset of 50,000 bar charts. The dataset comprises simple, stacked, and grouped bar charts, targeting the unique structural features of these visualizations. The finetuned DEPLOT model is evaluated against its base version using a test set of 1,000 images and two metrics: Relative Mapping Similarity (RMS), which measures categorical mapping accuracy, and Relative Number Set Similarity (RNSS), which evaluates numerical interpretation accuracy. To further explore the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we curate an additional set of 100 bar chart images paired with question answer sets. Our findings demonstrate that providing a structured intermediate table alongside the image significantly enhances LLM reasoning performance compared to direct image queries.

- **problems**: Automated models struggle with accurate information extraction from diverse and complex financial bar charts; existing hybrid OCR/rule systems are rigid and end-to-end models require massive fine-tuning; domain-specific charts with unique structures and terminology are poorly handled; current systems produce low structural and numerical accuracy.
- **problems-main-problem**: Accurate extraction and interpretation of categorical and numerical data from domain-specific (financial) bar charts of varying layouts (simple, stacked, grouped).
- **problems-focus-problem**: Enhancing both categorical mapping accuracy and numerical precision of DEPLOT-based table extraction for financial bar charts through targeted fine-tuning.
- **problems-why-important**: High-precision chart understanding is critical in finance for reliable decision-making; misaligned or erroneous data can lead to serious analytical and regulatory consequences; robust automated interpretation reduces manual effort and enables scalable querying.
- **motivations**: Existing DEPLOT model is general-purpose and underperforms on financial charts; leveraging intermediate structured tables can unlock LLMs’ reasoning power; smaller VLMs can outperform larger ones when given clean structured data; tailored datasets can drastically improve accuracy.
- **motivations-main-finding**: Fine-tuning DEPLOT on 50 k synthetic financial bar charts boosts RNSS from 89.67 % to 98.07 % and RMS F1 from 50.93 % to 91.06 %; supplying the resulting tables to LLMs reduces MAPE by up to 90.9 % and enables smaller models (e.g., LLaMa-11B) to outperform GPT-4o.
- **motivations-main-insight**: High-quality intermediate structured representations are more impactful than raw visual input for downstream reasoning; domain-specific fine-tuning of a modality-conversion model is a practical and scalable path to accurate chart VQA.
- **motivations-why-necessary**: Current end-to-end or OCR-based approaches cannot simultaneously achieve high numerical and structural accuracy across diverse chart types; structured representations bridge the modality gap and allow re-use of powerful text-based LLMs without retraining them on vision tasks.
- **solutions**: Fine-tune DEPLOT on a custom synthetic dataset of 50 k financial bar charts (simple, stacked, grouped); generate intermediate linearized tables; feed these tables to LLMs for question answering instead of raw images.
- **solutions-main-idea**: Translate chart images into accurate tabular data first, then let LLMs reason over the table; focus fine-tuning on domain-specific vocabulary, value ranges, and structural patterns.
- **solutions-main-method**: Generate diverse synthetic charts with randomized financial labels, categories, and values using Matplotlib/Seaborn; fine-tune DEPLOT for 10 epochs with AdamW on image-text pairs; evaluate with RNSS and RMS metrics; test downstream QA with multiple LLMs (GPT-4o, Qwen-2/7B-VL, LLaMa-11B).
- **solutions-main-result**: Fine-tuned DEPLOT achieves 98.07 % RNSS and 91.06 % RMS F1; downstream MAPE drops to as low as 2.06 % (LLaMa-11B) versus 16.07 % with image-only GPT-4o; smaller models consistently outperform larger ones when provided with fine-tuned tables.
- **solutions-main-conclusion**: Targeted fine-tuning of a modality-conversion model combined with structured intermediate representations delivers state-of-the-art accuracy for financial chart VQA and unlocks efficient querying via general LLMs.
- **potential-inspiration**: Extend approach to other domains (healthcare, marketing) by swapping label/value vocabularies; explore ensemble or error-correction models to further refine tables; develop multimodal fusion that selectively re-incorporates visual cues; investigate synthetic data augmentation for rare chart types; study robustness to noisy inputs, OCR errors, and adversarial visual perturbations; create interactive dashboards where users query fine-tuned tables in natural language.

- **abstract**: Real-world decision-making often requires integrating and reasoning over information from multiple modalities. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in such tasks, their ability to perform multi-hop reasoning across diverse sources remains insufficiently evaluated. Existing benchmarks, such as MMQA, face challenges due to (1) data contamination and (2) a lack of complex queries that necessitate operations across more than two modalities, hindering accurate performance assessment. To address this, we present Financial Cross-Modal Multi-Hop Reasoning (FCMR), a benchmark created to analyze the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs by urging them to combine information from textual reports, tables, and charts within the financial domain. FCMR is categorized into three difficulty levels-Easy, Medium, and Hard-facilitating a step-by-step evaluation. In particular, problems at the Hard level require precise cross-modal three-hop reasoning and are designed to prevent the disregard of any modality. Experiments on this new benchmark reveal that even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle, with the best-performing model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) achieving only 30.4% accuracy on the most challenging tier. We also conduct analysis to provide insights into the inner workings of the models, including the discovery of a critical bottleneck in the information retrieval phase.

- **problems**: Existing benchmarks (e.g., MMQA) suffer from data contamination via Wikipedia pretraining; only 0.8% of MMQA requires true three-modal three-hop reasoning; most benchmarks limit evaluation to two modalities and simple hops; models can solve questions without using visual clues, undermining evaluation validity
- **problems-main-problem**: Lack of a rigorous, contamination-free benchmark that forces models to perform genuine cross-modal three-hop reasoning across text, tables, and charts
- **problems-focus-problem**: Designing and validating FCMR, a benchmark that ensures all three modalities must be processed and that prevents models from bypassing any modality
- **problems-why-important**: Accurate assessment of MLLM reasoning is crucial for high-stakes finance decisions; current inflated scores mislead progress and mask fundamental weaknesses in information retrieval and reasoning
- **motivations**: Introduce FCMR with 757 Easy, 728 Medium, 714 Hard questions that demand three-modal integration; create CMRGen framework to generate low-cost, high-quality, domain-adaptable datasets; reveal severe limitations in state-of-the-art models (best Hard accuracy ≈30.4%)
- **motivations-main-finding**: Even top models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o) drop to near-random on Hard three-hop tasks; primary failure mode is Information Retrieval rather than Planning or Reasoning; scatter plots and negative-value calculations are especially challenging
- **motivations-main-insight**: Cross-modal multi-hop reasoning can be decomposed into four stages: Planning → Modality Identification → Information Retrieval → Information Reasoning; Information Retrieval is the critical bottleneck, not final reasoning
- **motivations-why-necessary**: Prior benchmarks give false confidence; rigorous evaluation is needed to drive real advances in multimodal reasoning for professional domains such as finance, law, medicine
- **solutions**: Propose CMRGen pipeline: (1) align SEC 10-K reports with WRDS Compustat tables and synthetic charts, (2) generate one- to three-hop statements via templates and LLMs, (3) paraphrase and human-filter for quality; adopt multiple-choice “select-all-true” format with company-based distractors to resist contamination
- **solutions-main-idea**: Force models to integrate text, table, and chart data by constructing questions whose answers cannot be inferred from any single modality or from prior pretraining knowledge
- **solutions-main-method**: Automated three-stage generation (Input Data Construction, Statement Generation, Paraphrasing & Filtering) plus human review; contamination check by ablating images and observing accuracy collapse to random
- **solutions-main-result**: FCMR demonstrates significant drops for all tested MLLMs at Hard level (12–30% accuracy vs 75% on Easy); open-source models <15% on Hard; modality integration + 4-stage prompting + self-refine raises Claude’s Hard accuracy from 32% to 46%
- **solutions-main-conclusion**: Current MLLMs are far from human-level cross-modal multi-hop reasoning; future work must target Information Retrieval improvements and specialized multimodal architectures; CMRGen is extensible to other domains (material science demonstrated)
- **potential-inspiration**: Extend CMRGen to law, biology, medicine, electrical engineering; develop retrieval-augmented or tool-calling MLLMs that explicitly ground each hop in the correct modality; investigate targeted training curricula that progressively build three-hop skills; create interactive evaluation where models can request missing modalities

- **abstract**: In recent years, multimodal benchmarks for general domains have guided the rapid development of multimodal models on general tasks. However, the financial field has its peculiarities. It features unique graphical images (e.g., candlestick charts, technical indicator charts) and possesses a wealth of specialized financial knowledge (e.g., futures, turnover rate). Therefore, benchmarks from general fields often fail to measure the performance of multimodal models in the financial domain, and thus cannot effectively guide the rapid development of large financial models. To promote the development of large financial multimodal models, we propose MME-Finance, an bilingual open-ended and practical usage-oriented Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark. The characteristics of our benchmark are finance and expertise, which include constructing charts that reflect the actual usage needs of users (e.g., computer screenshots and mobile photography), creating questions according to the preferences in financial domain inquiries, and annotating questions by experts with 10+ years of experience in the financial industry. Additionally, we have developed a custom-designed financial evaluation system in which visual information is first introduced in the multi-modal evaluation process. Extensive experimental evaluations of 19 mainstream MLLMs are conducted to test their perception, reasoning, and cognition capabilities. The results indicate that models performing well on general benchmarks cannot do well on MME-Finance; for instance, the top-performing open-source and closed-source models obtain 65.69 (Qwen2VL-72B) and 63.18 (GPT-4o), respectively. Their performance is particularly poor in categories most relevant to finance, such as candlestick charts and technical indicator charts. In addition, we propose a Chinese version, which helps compare performance of MLLMs under a Chinese context.

- **problems**: 1) General-domain multimodal benchmarks fail to capture the unique characteristics of finance (jargon, complexity, chart diversity, data density). 2) Absence of any multimodal benchmark specifically for finance. 3) Lack of bilingual (Chinese–English) multimodal financial datasets. 4) Existing MLLMs perform poorly on financial charts (candlestick, technical indicators) and mobile photographs. 5) Difficulty in evaluating open-ended financial questions with visual context.
- **problems-main-problem**: There is no dedicated multimodal benchmark that can accurately and comprehensively evaluate MLLMs on expert-level financial understanding and reasoning tasks.
- **problems-focus-problem**: Designing and validating MME-Finance, a bilingual, open-ended VQA benchmark that covers real-world financial charts and usage scenarios, and introducing a visual-aware evaluation protocol that aligns with human expert judgment.
- **problems-why-important**: Financial decisions require high accuracy and domain expertise; unreliable MLLMs could lead to monetary loss. A rigorous benchmark guides safer deployment and accelerated research for domain-specific multimodal models.
- **motivations**: 1) Need to bridge the gap between general multimodal benchmarks and finance-specific requirements. 2) Provide granular diagnostics (perception, reasoning, cognition) for MLLMs in finance. 3) Enable fair comparison of open-source vs. proprietary models under both English and Chinese contexts. 4) Highlight critical weaknesses (e.g., mobile photos, hallucination) to steer future improvements.
- **motivations-main-finding**: Top open-source (Qwen2VL-72B: 65.69 %) and closed-source (GPT-4o: 63.18 %) models still fall far short of expert-level performance, especially on candlestick/technical charts and mobile photographs.
- **motivations-main-insight**: Current MLLMs possess adequate general visual skills but lack fine-grained spatial awareness, estimation-based numerical reasoning, and domain-specific chart interpretation; evaluation must incorporate visual context to reach human-level consistency.
- **motivations-why-necessary**: Without these findings, the community would continue optimizing for general benchmarks while remaining blind to critical failures in high-stakes financial applications.
- **solutions**: Creation of MME-Finance: a bilingual 2,274-sample (1,171 EN + 1,103 CN) open-ended VQA benchmark covering six real-world financial image types; hierarchical task taxonomy (perception → reasoning → cognition); expert annotation pipeline (10+ yr finance experts); and an LLM-based evaluator (GPT-4o) that ingests both textual and visual inputs to score responses on a 0–5 scale.
- **solutions-main-idea**: Simulate genuine financial usage by collecting computer screenshots, mobile photos, and mobile screenshots; craft questions from OCR to investment advice; and enforce rigorous, visual-aware evaluation to measure true capability.
- **solutions-main-method**: Data collection via multi-platform scraping + mobile photography; two-stage manual QA generation & review; GPT-4o evaluator fine-tuned with task-specific prompts and few-shot examples; human-consistency validation (Spearman ρ = 0.720, Δ = 0.90).
- **solutions-main-result**: Released benchmark and evaluation suite; systematic evaluation of 19 MLLMs revealing severe deficits in spatial awareness (best 30.31 %), estimated numerical calculation (best 40.95 %), candlestick charts (best 60.12 %), and mobile photographs (best 58.31 %).
- **solutions-main-conclusion**: MME-Finance exposes significant limitations in current MLLMs for expert financial tasks and provides a reliable, extensible benchmark to guide future model development and risk-aware deployment.
- **potential-inspiration**: 1) Extend MME-Finance with multi-turn dialogues and larger sample sizes. 2) Develop specialized encoders for financial chart types (e.g., candlestick transformers). 3) Investigate resolution-robust vision backbones for mobile photography. 4) Explore hybrid evaluation combining LLM judges with symbolic financial engines. 5) Create continual-learning protocols that inject domain knowledge without catastrophic forgetting. 6) Apply benchmark methodology to other specialized domains (legal, scientific).

- **abstract**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in many vision-language tasks, yet their capabilities in fine-grained visual understanding remain insufficiently evaluated. Existing benchmarks either contain limited fine-grained evaluation samples that are mixed with other data, or are confined to object-level assessments in natural images. To holistically assess LVLMs' fine-grained visual understanding capabilities, we propose using document images with multi-granularity and multi-modal information to supplement natural images. In this light, we construct MMDocBench, a benchmark with various OCR-free document understanding tasks for the evaluation of fine-grained visual perception and reasoning abilities. MMDocBench defines 15 main tasks with 4,338 QA pairs and 11,353 supporting regions, covering various document images such as research papers, receipts, financial reports, Wikipedia tables, charts, and infographics. Based on MMDocBench, we conduct extensive experiments using 13 open-source and 3 proprietary advanced LVLMs, assessing their strengths and weaknesses across different tasks and document image types. The benchmark, task instructions, and evaluation code will be made publicly available.

- **abstract**: In this paper, we introduce FAMMA, an open-source benchmark for \underline{f}in\underline{a}ncial \underline{m}ultilingual \underline{m}ultimodal question \underline{a}nswering (QA). Our benchmark aims to evaluate the abilities of large language models (LLMs) in answering complex reasoning questions that require advanced financial knowledge. The benchmark has two versions: FAMMA-Basic consists of 1,945 questions extracted from university textbooks and exams, along with human-annotated answers and rationales; FAMMA-LivePro consists of 103 novel questions created by human domain experts, with answers and rationales held out from the public for a contamination-free evaluation. These questions cover advanced knowledge of 8 major subfields in finance (e.g., corporate finance, derivatives, and portfolio management). Some are in Chinese or French, while a majority of them are in English. Each question has some non-text data such as charts, diagrams, or tables. Our experiments reveal that FAMMA poses a significant challenge on LLMs, including reasoning models such as GPT-o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Additionally, we curated 1,270 reasoning trajectories of DeepSeek-R1 on the FAMMA-Basic data, and fine-tuned a series of open-source Qwen models using this reasoning data. We found that training a model on these reasoning trajectories can significantly improve its performance on FAMMA-LivePro. We released our leaderboard, data, code, and trained models at this https URL.

- **abstract**: Financial LLMs hold promise for advancing financial tasks and domain-specific applications. However, they are limited by scarce corpora, weak multimodal capabilities, and narrow evaluations, making them less suited for real-world application. To address this, we introduce \textit{Open-FinLLMs}, the first open-source multimodal financial LLMs designed to handle diverse tasks across text, tabular, time-series, and chart data, excelling in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings. The suite includes FinLLaMA, pre-trained on a comprehensive 52-billion-token corpus; FinLLaMA-Instruct, fine-tuned with 573K financial instructions; and FinLLaVA, enhanced with 1.43M multimodal tuning pairs for strong cross-modal reasoning. We comprehensively evaluate Open-FinLLMs across 14 financial tasks, 30 datasets, and 4 multimodal tasks in zero-shot, few-shot, and supervised fine-tuning settings, introducing two new multimodal evaluation datasets. Our results show that Open-FinLLMs outperforms afvanced financial and general LLMs such as GPT-4, across financial NLP, decision-making, and multi-modal tasks, highlighting their potential to tackle real-world challenges. To foster innovation and collaboration across academia and industry, we release all codes (this https URL) and models under OSI-approved licenses.

- **abstract**: Chart understanding plays a pivotal role when applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to real-world tasks such as analyzing scientific papers or financial reports. However, existing datasets often focus on oversimplified and homogeneous charts with template-based questions, leading to an over-optimistic measure of progress. We demonstrate that although open-source models can appear to outperform strong proprietary models on these benchmarks, a simple stress test with slightly different charts or questions can deteriorate performance by up to 34.5%. In this work, we propose CharXiv, a comprehensive evaluation suite involving 2,323 natural, challenging, and diverse charts from arXiv papers. CharXiv includes two types of questions: 1) descriptive questions about examining basic chart elements and 2) reasoning questions that require synthesizing information across complex visual elements in the chart. To ensure quality, all charts and questions are handpicked, curated, and verified by human experts. Our results reveal a substantial, previously underestimated gap between the reasoning skills of the strongest proprietary model (i.e., GPT-4o), which achieves 47.1% accuracy, and the strongest open-source model (i.e., InternVL Chat V1.5), which achieves 29.2%. All models lag far behind human performance of 80.5%, underscoring weaknesses in the chart understanding capabilities of existing MLLMs. We hope CharXiv facilitates future research on MLLM chart understanding by providing a more realistic and faithful measure of progress.

- **problems-why-important**: Accurate evaluation is crucial for guiding model development, identifying weaknesses, and ensuring MLLMs can reliably interpret charts in scientific papers, financial reports, and other real-world applications
- **motivations**: Introduce CharXiv, a new benchmark of 2,323 real-world charts from arXiv papers with human-curated descriptive and reasoning questions; demonstrate that existing benchmarks overestimate model capabilities; reveal significant gaps between open-source and proprietary models and between models and human performance
- **motivations-main-finding**: GPT-4o achieves 47.1% accuracy on reasoning questions vs. human 80.5%; strongest open-source model (InternVL Chat V1.5) only 29.2%; open-source models drop up to 34.5% under minor perturbations; descriptive accuracy is also much lower than human (92.1%)
- **motivations-main-insight**: Descriptive chart understanding is a prerequisite for reasoning; compositional and subplot-heavy charts are especially hard; models struggle to identify unanswerable questions; domain-specific patterns affect performance
- **motivations-why-necessary**: Prior benchmarks mislead researchers and practitioners by masking weaknesses; CharXiv provides a faithful, fine-grained measure of progress and guides future model improvements
- **solutions**: Construct CharXiv by curating real charts from arXiv 2020-2023 across 8 subjects; design two question types—descriptive (basic element extraction) and reasoning (complex synthesis); use human annotators to craft and validate all QAs; release validation set with answers and hold out test set for fair evaluation
- **solutions-main-idea**: Replace synthetic benchmarks with real, diverse charts and human-written questions to reveal true model capabilities and limitations
- **solutions-main-method**: Four-step pipeline: SigLIP-based chart candidate selection, human expert chart curation, human annotation of descriptive and reasoning questions, GPT-4o-based automated grading with human verification
- **solutions-main-result**: Comprehensive evaluation of 13 open-source and 11 proprietary MLLMs on CharXiv; detailed gap analysis by question type, chart complexity, subject domain, and perturbation sensitivity

- **abstract**: Much of modern practice in financial forecasting relies on technicals, an umbrella term for several heuristics applying visual pattern recognition to price charts. Despite its ubiquity in financial media, the reliability of its signals remains a contentious and highly subjective form of 'domain knowledge'. We investigate the predictive value of patterns in financial time series, applying machine learning and signal processing techniques to 22 years of US equity data. By reframing technical analysis as a poorly specified, arbitrarily preset feature-extractive layer in a deep neural network, we show that better convolutional filters can be learned directly from the data, and provide visual representations of the features being identified. We find that an ensemble of shallow, thresholded CNNs optimised over different resolutions achieves state-of-the-art performance on this domain, outperforming technical methods while retaining some of their interpretability.

- **base-core-group**: Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford
- **problems**: The reliability of visual technical-analysis patterns (candlesticks) in finance is contentious and poorly validated; existing chartist patterns are arbitrarily preset and lack rigorous statistical support; traditional technical indicators underperform relative to their claims; there is a need for interpretable yet accurate forecasting models for US equity data.
- **problems-main-problem**: Determining whether classical candlestick chart patterns have genuine predictive value for next-day US equity returns, and if not, how to replace them with data-driven, interpretable forecasting models.
- **problems-focus-problem**: Assessing the statistical significance of 22 years of S&P 500 candlestick patterns and designing an interpretable deep-learning architecture that outperforms these patterns while retaining visual explainability.
- **problems-why-important**: Reliable technical forecasting can improve trading profitability and risk management; debunking ineffective heuristics prevents misallocation of capital; interpretable ML models satisfy regulatory and practitioner demands for transparency in algorithmic trading.
- **motivations**: Demonstrate that traditional candlestick patterns have little actionable predictive power; show that shallow, thresholded CNN ensembles can learn superior, interpretable filters directly from price data; provide a rigorous statistical framework for evaluating pattern-based forecasting in finance.
- **motivations-main-finding**: Candlestick patterns rarely outperform random guessing; only six single-day patterns show significant distributional shifts, yet often in the opposite direction to chartist doctrine; an ensemble of thresholded 1-, 2-, and 3-day CNNs achieves 57.5 % accuracy on high-confidence samples, materially outperforming classical techniques and other ML baselines.
- **motivations-main-insight**: Technical analysis can be reframed as a poorly specified feature-extraction layer within a deep network; learning convolutional filters end-to-end yields both higher accuracy and interpretable templates that resemble—but outperform—classical patterns; confidence thresholding and ensembling are crucial for translating model outputs into profitable, low-turnover trading decisions.
- **motivations-why-necessary**: Prior literature lacks large-scale, rigorous statistical validation of candlestick efficacy; practitioners continue to rely on visually appealing but empirically weak patterns; demonstrating superior, data-driven alternatives bridges the gap between academic rigour and industry practice.
- **solutions**: Replace hand-crafted candlestick templates with trainable convolutional filters; stack multiple shallow CNNs optimised at different resolutions; apply softmax-thresholding to retain only high-confidence predictions; form a heterogeneous ensemble to blend multi-scale information.
- **solutions-main-idea**: Treat candlestick patterns as noisy, fixed kernels and learn optimal kernels directly from 22 years of S&P 500 open-high-low-close data; enforce sparsity via confidence thresholds to mimic high-conviction human traders; aggregate complementary models to exploit patterns across 1-, 2-, and 3-day horizons.
- **solutions-main-method**: Design 1-D CNNs with 8 filters of lengths 4, 8, 12 (days) followed by two dense layers; train on rolling 20-day windows; apply dropout for regularisation; threshold softmax probabilities at α tuned to retain the top 1 % highest-confidence predictions; average ensemble member probabilities for final decision.
- **solutions-main-result**: TCNN ensemble delivers 57.5 % accuracy on the top-centile samples, translating to 48.2× profit over 11 years without friction and 13.0× at 0.25 % transaction costs; Kolmogorov-Smirnov and ROC tests confirm all CNN variants significantly outperform random classification; learned filters visualise as interpretable candlestick-like motifs.
- **solutions-main-conclusion**: Classical candlestick patterns are statistically unreliable; shallow, thresholded CNN ensembles provide a robust, interpretable alternative; predictive information in raw price history is bounded, yet exploitable with careful modelling and execution; convolutional architectures surpass recurrent and other ML baselines on this task.
- **potential-inspiration**: Extend framework to intraday or multi-asset data and higher-frequency patterns; incorporate volume and order-book features for richer filters; explore meta-learning to adapt thresholds dynamically to regime shifts; investigate hybrid architectures combining CNN filters with attention or transformer layers for longer-horizon forecasts; develop formal interpretability metrics for learned candlestick motifs to aid regulatory acceptance.

- **abstract**: Multi-dimensional data streams, prevalent in applications like IoT, financial markets, and real-time analytics, pose significant challenges due to their high velocity, unbounded nature, and complex inter-dimensional dependencies. Sliding window techniques are critical for processing such streams, but fixed-size windows struggle to adapt to dynamic changes like concept drift or bursty patterns. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based approach to dynamically optimize sliding window sizes for multi-dimensional data streams. By formulating window size selection as an RL problem, we enable an agent to learn an adaptive policy based on stream characteristics, such as variance, correlations, and temporal trends. Our method, RL-Window, leverages a Dueling Deep Q-Network (DQN) with prioritized experience replay to handle non-stationarity and high-dimensionality. Evaluations on benchmark datasets (UCI HAR, PAMAP2, Yahoo! Finance Stream) demonstrate that RL-Window outperforms state-of-the-art methods like ADWIN and CNN-Adaptive in classification accuracy, drift robustness, and computational efficiency. Additional qualitative analyses, extended metrics (e.g., energy efficiency, latency), and a comprehensive dataset characterization further highlight its adaptability and stability, making it suitable for real-time applications.

- **abstract**: We introduce a decentralised, algorithmic framework for permissionless, multi-strategy capital allocation via tokenised, automated vaults. The system is designed to function analogously to a multi-strategy asset management company, but implemented entirely on-chain through a modular architecture comprising four interacting layers. The first, the capitalisation layer, composed of vaults that facilitate multi-asset deposits, tokenises investor participation, and specifies high level risk limits and admissible venues for deployment. The second, the strategy layer, enables the submission of strategies by human developers or autonomous agents, creating a decentralised marketplace governed by a validation mechanism incorporating adversarial and gamified elements. The third, the execution layer, operationalises strategy deployment using the host blockchain network's services. The fourth layer, the validated allocation layer, assesses and allocates capital among validated strategies, dynamically rebalancing toward those exhibiting superior risk-adjusted performance. In the framework, each admitted strategy acts as a manager for the "fund", encapsulated in a smart contract vault that issues transferable V-Tokens, conveying fractional ownership of the real-time portfolio operated by the vault. The system is designed to be open to participation by both human and AI agents, who collectively perform the roles of capital allocators, strategy developers, and validated allocators. The resulting structure is a self-regulating asset management ecosystem capable of decentralised, cooperative optimisation across traditional and digital financial domains. This framework is facilitated by a host chain network, which offers native automation and data oracle services enabling vault entities to autonomously operate on-chain, paving the way for being self sufficient in dynamic allocation of capital.

- **abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on numerous natural language processing tasks. However, LLMs still struggle with numerical question answering for financial documents that include tabular and textual data. Recent works have showed the effectiveness of critic agents (i.e., self-correction) for this task given oracle labels. Building upon this framework, this paper examines the effectiveness of the traditional critic agent when oracle labels are not available, and show, through experiments, that this critic agent's performance deteriorates in this scenario. With this in mind, we present an improved critic agent, along with the calculator agent which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach (program-of-thought) and is safer. Furthermore, we investigate how our agents interact with each other, and how this interaction affects their performance.

- **abstract**: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems serve as the digital backbone of modern financial institutions, yet they continue to rely on static, rule-based workflows that limit adaptability, scalability, and intelligence. As business operations grow more complex and data-rich, conventional ERP platforms struggle to integrate structured and unstructured data in real time and to accommodate dynamic, cross-functional workflows.
In this paper, we present the first AI-native, agent-based framework for ERP systems, introducing a novel architecture of Generative Business Process AI Agents (GBPAs) that bring autonomy, reasoning, and dynamic optimization to enterprise workflows. The proposed system integrates generative AI with business process modeling and multi-agent orchestration, enabling end-to-end automation of complex tasks such as budget planning, financial reporting, and wire transfer processing. Unlike traditional workflow engines, GBPAs interpret user intent, synthesize workflows in real time, and coordinate specialized sub-agents for modular task execution. We validate the framework through case studies in bank wire transfers and employee reimbursements, two representative financial workflows with distinct complexity and data modalities. Results show that GBPAs achieve up to 40% reduction in processing time, 94% drop in error rate, and improved regulatory compliance by enabling parallelism, risk control insertion, and semantic reasoning. These findings highlight the potential of GBPAs to bridge the gap between generative AI capabilities and enterprise-grade automation, laying the groundwork for the next generation of intelligent ERP systems.

- **abstract**: Extracting structured and quantitative insights from unstructured financial filings is essential in investment research, yet remains time-consuming and resource-intensive. Conventional approaches in practice rely heavily on labor-intensive manual processes, limiting scalability and delaying the research workflow. In this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable method for accurately extracting quantitative insights from unstructured financial documents, leveraging a multi-agent system composed of large language models. Our proposed multi-agent system consists of two specialized agents: the \emph{Extraction Agent} and the \emph{Text-to-SQL Agent}. The \textit{Extraction Agent} automatically identifies key performance indicators from unstructured financial text, standardizes their formats, and verifies their accuracy. On the other hand, the \textit{Text-to-SQL Agent} generates executable SQL statements from natural language queries, allowing users to access structured data accurately without requiring familiarity with the database schema. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed system effectively transforms unstructured text into structured data accurately and enables precise retrieval of key information. First, we demonstrate that our system achieves approximately 95\% accuracy in transforming financial filings into structured data, matching the performance level typically attained by human annotators. Second, in a human evaluation of the retrieval task -- where natural language queries are used to search information from structured data -- 91\% of the responses were rated as correct by human evaluators. In both evaluations, our system generalizes well across financial document types, consistently delivering reliable performance.

- **problems**: Extracting structured and quantitative insights from unstructured financial filings is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Traditional manual processes are slow, error-prone, and lack standardization. Existing LLM-based methods often misinterpret numeric guidance, extract incorrect values, or omit critical metrics due to layout sensitivity and difficulty in distinguishing factual signals from narratives.
- **problems-main-problem**: The main problem is the inefficiency and inaccuracy of extracting and retrieving structured financial insights from unstructured financial documents, which limits scalability and delays research workflows.
- **problems-focus-problem**: The key problem is the unreliability of LLMs when used in isolation for financial document analysis, leading to errors in extracting key performance indicators (KPIs) and generating executable SQL queries.
- **problems-why-important**: The problem is important because accurate and timely extraction of financial KPIs is crucial for informed decision-making in investment research. Manual processes are impractical given the increasing volume of financial documents, and existing automated methods are insufficiently reliable.
- **motivations**: The paper proposes a multi-agent system to address the limitations of existing methods by leveraging large language models (LLMs) in a collaborative framework to improve accuracy, reduce hallucinations, and enhance reliability in financial document analysis.
- **motivations-main-finding**: The proposed multi-agent system achieves approximately 95% accuracy in transforming financial filings into structured data and 91% accuracy in retrieving information using natural language queries.

- **abstract**: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with investor decision-making processes under herd behavior is a critical challenge in behavioral finance, which grapples with a fundamental limitation: the scarcity of real-user data needed for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). While SFT can bridge the gap between LLM outputs and human behavioral patterns, its reliance on massive authentic data imposes substantial collection costs and privacy risks. We propose InvestAlign, a novel framework that constructs high-quality SFT datasets by leveraging theoretical solutions to similar and simple optimal investment problems rather than complex scenarios. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that training LLMs with InvestAlign-generated data achieves faster parameter convergence than using real-user data, suggesting superior learning efficiency. Furthermore, we develop InvestAgent, an LLM agent fine-tuned with InvestAlign, which demonstrates significantly closer alignment to real-user data than pre-SFT models in both simple and complex investment problems. This highlights our proposed InvestAlign as a promising approach with the potential to address complex optimal investment problems and align LLMs with investor decision-making processes under herd behavior.

We evaluate 6 state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse scenarios, revealing significant vulnerabilities: attacks reduced agent task completion rates (TCR) by 36.78% on average and achieved an 85.65% success rate in academic settings. Notably, scaling laws held for security capabilities, with larger models outperforming smaller counterparts.

- **abstract**: We introduce ChatGLM, an evolving family of large language models that we have been developing over time. This report primarily focuses on the GLM-4 language series, which includes GLM-4, GLM-4-Air, and GLM-4-9B. They represent our most capable models that are trained with all the insights and lessons gained from the preceding three generations of ChatGLM. To date, the GLM-4 models are pre-trained on ten trillions of tokens mostly in Chinese and English, along with a small set of corpus from 24 languages, and aligned primarily for Chinese and English usage. The high-quality alignment is achieved via a multi-stage post-training process, which involves supervised fine-tuning and learning from human feedback. Evaluations show that GLM-4 1) closely rivals or outperforms GPT-4 in terms of general metrics such as MMLU, GSM8K, MATH, BBH, GPQA, and HumanEval, 2) gets close to GPT-4-Turbo in instruction following as measured by IFEval, 3) matches GPT-4 Turbo (128K) and Claude 3 for long context tasks, and 4) outperforms GPT-4 in Chinese alignments as measured by AlignBench. The GLM-4 All Tools model is further aligned to understand user intent and autonomously decide when and which tool(s) touse -- including web browser, Python interpreter, text-to-image model, and user-defined functions -- to effectively complete complex tasks. In practical applications, it matches and even surpasses GPT-4 All Tools in tasks like accessing online information via web browsing and solving math problems using Python interpreter. Over the course, we have open-sourced a series of models, including ChatGLM-6B (three generations), GLM-4-9B (128K, 1M), GLM-4V-9B, WebGLM, and CodeGeeX, attracting over 10 million downloads on Hugging face in the year 2023 alone.

Kimi-VL demonstrates strong performance across challenging domains: as a general-purpose VLM, Kimi-VL excels in multi-turn agent tasks (e.g., OSWorld), matching flagship models. Furthermore, it exhibits remarkable capabilities across diverse challenging vision language tasks, including college-level image and video comprehension, OCR, mathematical reasoning, and multi-image understanding. In comparative evaluations, it effectively competes with cutting-edge efficient VLMs such as GPT-4o-mini, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, and Gemma-3-12B-IT, while surpassing GPT-4o in several key domains. Kimi-VL also advances in processing long contexts and perceiving clearly. With a 128K extended context window, Kimi-VL can process diverse long inputs, achieving impressive scores of 64.5 on LongVideoBench and 35.1 on MMLongBench-Doc.

- **abstract**: We introduce InternVL3, a significant advancement in the InternVL series featuring a native multimodal pre-training paradigm. Rather than adapting a text-only large language model (LLM) into a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that supports visual inputs, InternVL3 jointly acquires multimodal and linguistic capabilities from both diverse multimodal data and pure-text corpora during a single pre-training stage. This unified training paradigm effectively addresses the complexities and alignment challenges commonly encountered in conventional post-hoc training pipelines for MLLMs. To further improve performance and scalability, InternVL3 incorporates variable visual position encoding (V2PE) to support extended multimodal contexts, employs advanced post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and mixed preference optimization (MPO), and adopts test-time scaling strategies alongside an optimized training infrastructure. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that InternVL3 delivers superior performance across a wide range of multi-modal tasks. In particular, InternVL3-78B achieves a score of 72.2 on the MMMU benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art among open-source MLLMs. Its capabilities remain highly competitive with leading proprietary models, including ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, while also maintaining strong pure-language proficiency.

- **abstract**: This work investigates a simple yet powerful dense prediction task adapter for Vision Transformer (ViT). Unlike recently advanced variants that incorporate vision-specific inductive biases into their architectures, the plain ViT suffers inferior performance on dense predictions due to weak prior assumptions. To address this issue, we propose the ViT-Adapter, which allows plain ViT to achieve comparable performance to vision-specific transformers. Specifically, the backbone in our framework is a plain ViT that can learn powerful representations from large-scale multi-modal data. When transferring to downstream tasks, a pre-training-free adapter is used to introduce the image-related inductive biases into the model, making it suitable for these tasks. We verify ViT-Adapter on multiple dense prediction tasks, including object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Notably, without using extra detection data, our ViT-Adapter-L yields state-of-the-art 60.9 box AP and 53.0 mask AP on COCO test-dev. We hope that the ViT-Adapter could serve as an alternative for vision-specific transformers and facilitate future research. The code and models will be released at this https URL.

- **abstract**: State-of-the-art computer vision systems are trained to predict a fixed set of predetermined object categories. This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on. We release our code and pre-trained model weights at this https URL.

    Scaling up neural networks has led to remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. Moreover, performance often follows reliable scaling laws as a function of training set size, model size, and compute, which offers valuable guidance as large-scale experiments are becoming increasingly expensive. However, previous work on scaling laws has primarily used private data \& models or focused on uni-modal language or vision learning. To address these limitations, we investigate scaling laws for contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) with the public LAION dataset and the open-source OpenCLIP repository. Our large-scale experiments involve models trained on up to two billion image-text pairs and identify power law scaling for multiple downstream tasks including zero-shot classification, retrieval, linear probing, and end-to-end fine-tuning. We find that the training distribution plays a key role in scaling laws as the OpenAI and OpenCLIP models exhibit different scaling behavior despite identical model architectures and similar training recipes. We open-source our evaluation workflow and all models, including the largest public CLIP models, to ensure reproducibility and make scaling laws research more accessible.

- **abstract**: Large training sets have become a cornerstone of machine learning and are the foundation for recent advances in language modeling and multimodal learning. While data curation for pre-training is often still ad-hoc, one common paradigm is to first collect a massive pool of data from the Web and then filter this candidate pool down to an actual training set via various heuristics. In this work, we study the problem of learning a data filtering network (DFN) for this second step of filtering a large uncurated dataset. Our key finding is that the quality of a network for filtering is distinct from its performance on downstream tasks: for instance, a model that performs well on ImageNet can yield worse training sets than a model with low ImageNet accuracy that is trained on a small amount of high-quality data. Based on our insights, we construct new data filtering networks that induce state-of-the-art image-text datasets. Specifically, our best performing dataset DFN-5B enables us to train state-of-the-art CLIP models for their compute budgets: among other improvements on a variety of tasks, a ViT-H trained on our dataset achieves 84.4% zero-shot transfer accuracy on ImageNet, out-performing models trained on other datasets such as LAION-2B, DataComp-1B, or OpenAI's WIT. In order to facilitate further research in dataset design, we also release a new 2 billion example dataset DFN-2B and show that high performance data filtering networks can be trained from scratch using only publicly available data.

- **abstract**: We propose a simple pairwise Sigmoid loss for Language-Image Pre-training (SigLIP). Unlike standard contrastive learning with softmax normalization, the sigmoid loss operates solely on image-text pairs and does not require a global view of the pairwise similarities for normalization. The sigmoid loss simultaneously allows further scaling up the batch size, while also performing better at smaller batch sizes. Combined with Locked-image Tuning, with only four TPUv4 chips, we train a SigLiT model that achieves 84.5% ImageNet zero-shot accuracy in two days. The disentanglement of the batch size from the loss further allows us to study the impact of examples vs pairs and negative to positive ratio. Finally, we push the batch size to the extreme, up to one million, and find that the benefits of growing batch size quickly diminish, with a more reasonable batch size of 32k being sufficient. We release our models at this https URL and hope our research motivates further explorations in improving the quality and efficiency of language-image pre-training.

- **abstract**: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) typically integrate a pre-trained LLM with another pre-trained vision transformer through a connector, such as an MLP, endowing the LLM with visual capabilities. However, the misalignment between two embedding strategies in MLLMs -- the structural textual embeddings based on an embedding look-up table and the continuous embeddings generated directly by the vision encoder -- makes challenges for a more seamless fusion of visual and textual information. We propose Ovis, a novel MLLM architecture designed to structurally align visual and textual embeddings. Ovis integrates an additional learnable visual embedding table into the visual encoder's process. To capture rich visual semantics, each image patch indexes the visual embedding table multiple times, resulting in a final visual embedding that is a probabilistic combination of the indexed embeddings. This structural approach mirrors the method used for generating textual embeddings. Empirical evaluations on various multimodal benchmarks show that Ovis outperforms open-source MLLMs of similar parameter scales and even surpasses the proprietary model Qwen-VL-Plus overall. These results highlight the potential of Ovis' structured visual representation for advancing MLLM architectural design and promoting more effective multimodal learning.

- **abstract**: Visual language models (VLMs) have made significant advances in accuracy in recent years. However, their efficiency has received much less attention. This paper introduces NVILA, a family of open VLMs designed to optimize both efficiency and accuracy. Building on top of VILA, we improve its model architecture by first scaling up the spatial and temporal resolutions, and then compressing visual tokens. This "scale-then-compress" approach enables NVILA to efficiently process high-resolution images and long videos. We also conduct a systematic investigation to enhance the efficiency of NVILA throughout its entire lifecycle, from training and fine-tuning to deployment. NVILA matches or surpasses the accuracy of many leading open and proprietary VLMs across a wide range of image and video benchmarks. At the same time, it reduces training costs by 4.5X, fine-tuning memory usage by 3.4X, pre-filling latency by 1.6-2.2X, and decoding latency by 1.2-2.8X. We will soon make our code and models available to facilitate reproducibility.

- **abstract**: LLMs have transformed NLP and shown promise in various fields, yet their potential in finance is underexplored due to a lack of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, the rapid development of LLMs, and the complexity of financial tasks. In this paper, we introduce FinBen, the first extensive open-source evaluation benchmark, including 36 datasets spanning 24 financial tasks, covering seven critical aspects: information extraction (IE), textual analysis, question answering (QA), text generation, risk management, forecasting, and decision-making. FinBen offers several key innovations: a broader range of tasks and datasets, the first evaluation of stock trading, novel agent and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evaluation, and three novel open-source evaluation datasets for text summarization, question answering, and stock trading. Our evaluation of 15 representative LLMs, including GPT-4, ChatGPT, and the latest Gemini, reveals several key findings: While LLMs excel in IE and textual analysis, they struggle with advanced reasoning and complex tasks like text generation and forecasting. GPT-4 excels in IE and stock trading, while Gemini is better at text generation and forecasting. Instruction-tuned LLMs improve textual analysis but offer limited benefits for complex tasks such as QA. FinBen has been used to host the first financial LLMs shared task at the FinNLP-AgentScen workshop during IJCAI-2024, attracting 12 teams. Their novel solutions outperformed GPT-4, showcasing FinBen's potential to drive innovation in financial LLMs. All datasets, results, and codes are released for the research community: this https URL.

- **abstract**: Monetary policy pronouncements by Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) are a major driver of financial market returns. We construct the largest tokenized and annotated dataset of FOMC speeches, meeting minutes, and press conference transcripts in order to understand how monetary policy influences financial markets. In this study, we develop a novel task of hawkish-dovish classification and benchmark various pre-trained language models on the proposed dataset. Using the best-performing model (RoBERTa-large), we construct a measure of monetary policy stance for the FOMC document release days. To evaluate the constructed measure, we study its impact on the treasury market, stock market, and macroeconomic indicators. Our dataset, models, and code are publicly available on Huggingface and GitHub under CC BY-NC 4.0 license.

- **problems**: traditional sentiment models misclassify monetary policy stance; rule-based and unsupervised approaches perform poorly on hawkish-dovish task; lack of annotated FOMC corpora; need for market-relevant stance measure
- **problems-main-problem**: inability of existing NLP methods to accurately extract and quantify Federal Reserve monetary policy stance (hawkish vs dovish) from FOMC communications
- **problems-focus-problem**: creating a high-quality labeled dataset and a robust classifier that can reliably distinguish hawkish, dovish and neutral sentences in FOMC texts
- **problems-why-important**: FOMC words move trillions of dollars in equity and treasury markets; accurate stance detection is essential for policymakers, investors and researchers to understand and predict market reactions
- **motivations**: demonstrate limitations of rule-based and sentiment models; introduce new classification task; release largest annotated FOMC corpus; validate stance measure with market outcomes

- **abstract**: Financial information is generated and distributed across the world, resulting in a vast amount of domain-specific multilingual data. Multilingual models adapted to the financial domain would ease deployment when an organization needs to work with multiple languages on a regular basis. For the development and evaluation of such models, there is a need for multilingual financial language processing datasets. We describe MultiFin – a publicly available financial dataset consisting of real-world article headlines covering 15 languages across different writing systems and language families. The dataset consists of hierarchical label structure providing two classification tasks: multi-label and multi-class. We develop our annotation schema based on a real-world application and annotate our dataset using both ‘label by native-speaker’ and ‘translate-then-label’ approaches. The evaluation of several popular multilingual models, e.g., mBERT, XLM-R, and mT5, show that although decent accuracy can be achieved in high-resource languages, there is substantial room for improvement in low-resource languages.

- **problems**: (1) Lack of multilingual financial NLP datasets that cover diverse languages, writing systems and language families; (2) Performance gap between high- and low-resource languages for existing multilingual models in the financial domain; (3) Need for rigorous benchmark to evaluate cross-lingual and multilingual capabilities of financial language models
- **problems-main-problem**: Absence of a large-scale, publicly available multilingual financial dataset that realistically reflects worldwide multilingual financial communication and enables fair evaluation of domain-specific multilingual models
- **problems-focus-problem**: How to create a high-quality multilingual financial dataset and benchmark to rigorously measure and reduce the performance disparity between high-resource and low-resource languages in financial NLP tasks
- **problems-why-important**: Financial information is inherently global and multilingual; multinational organizations need reliable multilingual models to process invoices, transactions, tax policies, stock market news, etc. Without such resources, deployment of NLP in real-world multilingual finance remains limited and inequitable across languages
- **motivations**: (a) Present the first massively multilingual financial dataset with hierarchical labels; (b) Provide rigorous baselines for 4 popular multilingual models and 2 fastText baselines; (c) Demonstrate that domain-adaptive pre-training significantly boosts low-resource language performance; (d) Identify concrete directions for narrowing the high- vs low-resource gap
- **motivations-main-finding**: XLM-R achieves best overall performance but still exhibits substantial drops on low-resource languages; a simple LSTM with aligned fastText embeddings is surprisingly competitive; domain-adaptive pre-training on financial text yields consistent improvements, especially for zero-shot transfer to low-resource languages
- **motivations-main-insight**: “Curse of multilinguality” persists in finance: more pre-training languages and domain-specific adaptation are complementary strategies; explicit embedding alignment (fastText+RCSLS) can rival transformer transfer in some settings; translation-then-label pipeline yields high-quality annotations when native experts are scarce
- **motivations-why-necessary**: Existing financial NLP research is overwhelmingly English-centric; global finance requires equitable multilingual capabilities; without a dedicated benchmark, progress toward robust low-resource performance cannot be measured or guided
- **solutions**: (1) Creation of MULTIFIN: 10,048 headlines in 15 languages with hierarchical LOW-LEVEL (23 fine-grained, multi-label) and HIGH-LEVEL (6 coarse, single-label) topics; (2) Dual annotation workflow: native-speaker labeling for EN/DA and translate-then-label for others with quality validation; (3) Comprehensive benchmark evaluating mBERT, XLM-R, mT5, SBERT, fastText-LSTM/BAG under three training conditions (ALL, ENGLISH, HIGH-RESOURCE); (4) Evaluation of domain-adaptive mBERT variant and translation-based monolingual RoBERTa baseline
- **solutions-main-idea**: Combine real-world multilingual financial headlines with hierarchical annotation to create a rigorous benchmark that exposes and quantifies the high- vs low-resource performance gap, then test multiple modeling paradigms and domain-adaptation strategies to identify best practices
- **solutions-main-method**: (a) Data collection from PwC public article archive; (b) Hierarchical label schema derived from internal taxonomies; (c) Annotation by native speakers + translate-then-label with κ=0.94 agreement; (d) Controlled experiments: macro/micro F1 on LOW-LEVEL multi-label, accuracy on HIGH-LEVEL multi-class; (e) Wilcoxon tests for significance
- **solutions-main-result**: XLM-R: 90.8/83.9 micro-F1 on ALL/LOW-RESOURCE; mBERT: 88.6/77.9; mT5: 81.3/51.0; fastText-LSTM: 85.4/74.4; domain-adaptive mBERT outperforms vanilla by +1.0–5.5 F1; monolingual RoBERTa on translated data slightly beats multilingual XLM-R (84 vs 82–84)
- **solutions-main-conclusion**: MULTIFIN establishes the first rigorous multilingual financial benchmark; large-scale multilingual pre-training helps but does not close the low-resource gap; domain-adaptive pre-training and explicit cross-lingual alignment are promising; future work must expand data coverage and investigate document-level modeling
- **potential-inspiration**: (1) Extend MULTIFIN to full articles and additional languages (Indic, African, Arabic, Chinese); (2) Explore continual domain-adaptive pre-training on streaming financial corpora; (3) Investigate prompt-based or instruction-tuned multilingual LLMs for finance; (4) Combine embedding alignment with adapter modules for lightweight low-resource adaptation; (5) Leverage noisy web financial data via weak supervision to scale low-resource language coverage; (6) Examine fairness and bias across languages and regions in financial NLP outputs
